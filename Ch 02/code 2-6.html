<p>The city has a history of over 3,000 years, dating back to the time of the Median
empire, when it was known as Ysatis (or Issatis). The present city name has however been
derived from Yazdegerd I, a Sassanid ruler. The city was definitely a Zoroastrian centre
during Sassanid times. After the Arab Islamic conquest of Persia, many Zoroastrians fled to
Yazd from neighbouring provinces. The city remained Zoroastrian even after the conquest by
paying a levy, and only gradually did Islam come to be the dominant religion in the
city.</p>

    Because of its remote desert location and the difficulty of approach, Yazd had
remained largely immune to large battles and the destruction and ravages of war. For
instance, it was a haven for those fleeing from destruction in other parts of Persia during the
invasion of Genghis Khan. It was visited by Marco Polo in 1272 who remarked on the city's
fine silk-weaving industry. It briefly served as the capital of the Muzaffarid Dynasty in the
fourteenth century, and was sieged unsuccessfully in 1350â€“1351 by the Injuids under Shaikh
Abu Ishaq. The Friday (or Congregation) Mosque, arguably the city's greatest architectural
landmark, as well as other important buildings, date to this period. During the Qajar dynasty
(18th Century AD) it was ruled by the Bakhtiari Khans.

<p>Under the rule of the Safavis (16th century), some people emigrated from Yazd and
settled in an area which is today on the Iran-Afghanistan border. The settlement was named
Yazdi. This place is currently on the Iran-Afghanistan border in the province of Farah, in
Farah city in Afghanistan. Even today, these people speak with an accent very similar to that
of the people of Yazd.</p>
