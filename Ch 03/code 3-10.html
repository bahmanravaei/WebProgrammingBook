The city has a history of over 3,000 years, dating back to the time of the Median
empire, when it was known as Ysatis (or Issatis). The present city name has however been
derived from Yazdegerd I, a Sassanid ruler. The city was definitely a Zoroastrian centre
during Sassanid times. After the Arab Islamic conquest of Persia, many Zoroastrians fled to
Yazd from neighbouring provinces. The city remained Zoroastrian even after the conquest by
paying a levy, and only gradually did Islam come to be the dominant religion in the city.
